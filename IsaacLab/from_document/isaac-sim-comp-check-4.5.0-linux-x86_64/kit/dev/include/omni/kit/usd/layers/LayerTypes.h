/**
 * Regards of edit mode, it's extended by Kit to support customized workflow.
 * USD supports to switch edit target so that all authoring will take place in
 * that layer. When it's working with multiple sublayers, this kind of freedom
 * may cause experience issues. The user has to be aware the changes he/she made are
 * not overrided in any stronger layer. We extend a new mode called "auto authoring"
 * is to improve this. In this mode, all changes will firstly go into a middle delegate
 * layer and it will distribute them into their corresponding layers where it has the strongest
 * opinions. So it cannot switch edit target freely, and user does not need to be
 * aware of existence of multi-sublayers and how USD will compose the changes.
 * Besides, there is one more extended mode called "spec linking", which is based on
 * auto authoring. In this mode, user can customize the target layer of specific specs.
