/**
 * @brief A CheckBox is an option button that can be switched on (checked) or off (unchecked). Checkboxes are typically
 * used to represent features in an application that can be enabled or disabled without affecting others.
 *
 * The checkbox is implemented using the model-view pattern. The model is the central component of this system. It is
 * the application's dynamic data structure independent of the widget. It directly manages the data, logic, and rules of
 * the checkbox. If the model is not specified, the simple one is created automatically when the object is constructed.
