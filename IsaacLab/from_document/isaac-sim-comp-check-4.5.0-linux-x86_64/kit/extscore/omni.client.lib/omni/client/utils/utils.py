"""
omni.client handles URLs only, while Kit, as an authoring tool, needs to support both URLs and raw file system paths.
Although omni.client can handle raw file system paths, it's still not ideal as what we want because of the following
issues:

    * It cannot handle anonymous layer identifier from USD. For example, calling omni.client.normalize_url on an
      anonymous layer identifier may encode the layer identifier, which is not what we want as it changes the
      identifier.
    * Kit supports both local filesystem and remote servers, and the source paths include both local raw filesystem
      paths, and standard URLs. Developers may feed in different URL or path style. For non-local filesystem URLs,
      it's not different as omni.client. While we want to handle local raw filesystem paths and URLs prefixed with "file:"
      uniformly and they could get consistent output, so that the local paths authored into USD could be consumed
      by non-Kit applications, like USDView.

To resolve the above two issues, omni.client.utils provides utilities built on top of omni.client. The APIs
defined here could consume 3 types of URLs or paths:

    * Raw filesystem path without scheme, like local system path `c:/test/path/xxxx`.
    * URLs with scheme, like `omniverse://xxx`.
    * USD anonymous identifier, like `anon:xxxx`.

The difference between omni.client API and the utils here is that they will always output raw filesystem paths if
the input paths or URLs are raw filesystem paths or URLs with scheme `file:`. For other URLs, they are handled
the same as omni.client. Also, it will skip handling to anonymous layer identifier from USD.
