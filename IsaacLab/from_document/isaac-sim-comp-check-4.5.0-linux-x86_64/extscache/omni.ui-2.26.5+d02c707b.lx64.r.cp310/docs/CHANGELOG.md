### Added
- Two new settings have been added to the UI Workspace settings allowing control

  `/exts/omni.ui/workpace/draw_freeze/enabled` allows to enable or disable
  the draw freezing functionality. This provides a smoother user experience
  by reducing visual "blinking" during rapid layout changes.
- The `draw_freeze_frames` setting at
  `/exts/omni.ui/workpace/draw_freeze/frames` lets specify the number of
  frames the UI will wait after a layout change before it resumes normal
  drawing operations. This allows more control over the amount of time the
  layout change will take effect visually.
